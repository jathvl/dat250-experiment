# DAT250 Experiment 3 report

In this experiment, I've implemented a frontend SPA for the polling app using Svelte.

See a demo video of the application here: https://github.com/jathvl/dat250-experiment/issues/1

This is my first time trying Svelte (from React), and I'm very pleasantly surprised by its developer experience,
particularly the fact that you can mutate reactive variables just as you would any other JavaScript variable.
The templating language also felt nice.

I put it all in the same file, and worried minimally about styling.
Still, it works fine, allowing you to:
- create a user or log in (without any security measures)
- create a poll with question, expiry, and a variable number of options
- vote in a poll (one vote per user, able to change vote)
- delete a poll (again, no security measures)

## Formal report requirements:
- I encountered no technical issues when completing this assignment.
- The code for this project is available here: https://github.com/jathvl/dat250-experiment (specifically the `poll-frontend` directory).
- I don't think there are pending issues to be resolved for the assignment to be up to specifications.
